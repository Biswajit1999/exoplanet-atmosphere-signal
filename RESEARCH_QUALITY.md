# Research Quality Upgrade

This repository has been upgraded with a compact research-quality layer: reference anchors, validation checks, and explicit scientific/software boundaries.

## Scope

Exoplanet Atmosphere Signal upgraded with reproducibility metadata, reference anchors, validation scripts and research-quality documentation.

## Equations And Models

- Data provenance integrity
- Finite numerical measurement checks
- Reproducible figure/report validation

## Reference Anchors

The file `data/research-reference.json` stores benchmark anchors used by `scripts/validate_repository.mjs`. These are intentionally small and auditable so the repository can be checked without network access.

## Reproducibility Upgrade

The validation layer checks source files, reference data, README citations, and incomplete scaffold markers.
